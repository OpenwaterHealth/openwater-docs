## What is Openwater?

Openwater is building **the Linux of medical devices** - an open-source ecosystem where global innovators collaborate to create accessible, high-quality medical imaging and therapeutic technologies.

### Two Core Platforms

=== "OpenLIFU"

    **Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Platform**
    
    Non-invasive brain stimulation and therapeutic ultrasound system enabling:
    
    - Precise targeting of brain regions
    - Treatment planning and monitoring
    - Safety-compliant pulse sequences
    - Integration with clinical imaging (MRI, CT)
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: OpenLIFU Documentation](openlifu/index.md)

=== "OpenMOTION"

    **Near-Infrared Optical Imaging Platform**
    
    Real-time blood flow and oxygenation monitoring for:
    
    - Continuous patient monitoring
    - Stroke detection and prevention
    - Surgical guidance
    - Research applications
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: OpenMOTION Documentation](openmotion/index.md)

## Why Open Source?

### The Medical Device Crisis

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   **$119M** Average development cost
-   **72%** Market control by 3 companies
-   **3.5B** People without basic medical imaging
-   **7 years** Typical time to market

</div>

### The Open-Source Solution

**Network Effects:** Following Metcalfe's Law, platform value grows exponentially with contributors.

- **Reduced Costs:** 87% reduction in development costs
- **Faster Innovation:** 75% faster time to market
- **Global Collaboration:** 100x scale with 5,000+ potential contributors
- **Universal Access:** Enabling deployment to 85% of global population

!!! success "Proven Model"
    Our approach follows successful open-source medical platforms like 3D Slicer (1,000+ developers) and adapts proven business models from Red Hat and Linux Foundation.

## Latest Updates

!!! tip "License Transition to Apache 2.0"
    We've transitioned from AGPL 3.0 to Apache 2.0 to enable clinical translation and remove barriers for the medical imaging community. [Learn more about this decision](about/license-transition.md).

!!! info "3D Slicer Integration"
    SlicerOpenLIFU extension now available with Apache 2.0 license for seamless integration with the medical imaging ecosystem.

## Core Principles

=== "Open Source, Always"
    All core platform code released under Apache 2.0. Hardware designs under permissive licenses.

=== "Clinical Translation"
    Designed for FDA clearance and CE marking pathways from the start.

=== "Community-Driven"
    Governed by Technical Steering Committee with academic and community representation.

=== "Safety First"
    Comprehensive safety monitoring, validation datasets, and quality assurance.

=== "Permissionless Innovation"
    Anyone can contribute, fork, and commercialize without restrictive licensing.
